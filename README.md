# Data Structure and Algorithm Visualizer

## Overview

This project is a React-based web application that provides interactive visualizations for various data structures and algorithms. It aims to help myself understand the inner workings of fundamental computer science concepts through visual representations.

Currently, the visualizer includes:
1. Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort and Quick Sort)
2. Binary Search Tree operations

## Features

### Sorting Visualizer:
- Visualize Bubble Sort and Quick Sort algorithms
- Generate random arrays for sorting
- Step-by-step visual representation of the sorting process

### Binary Search Tree Visualizer:
- Insert nodes into a Binary Search Tree
- Visual representation of the tree structure

### User Interface:
- Switch between different visualizers
- Interactive controls for each visualization

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/huntomiddo/DSA-Visualizer.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd DSA-Visualizer
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

### Sorting Visualizer:
1. Click on "Sorting Algorithms" in the navigation menu
2. Use the "Reset Array" button to generate a new random array
3. Click on "Bubble Sort" or "Quick Sort" to visualize the respective sorting algorithm

### Binary Search Tree Visualizer:
1. Click on "Binary Search Tree" in the navigation menu
2. Enter a number in the input field and click "Insert" to add a node to the tree
3. The tree structure will update automatically to show the new node

## Technologies Used

- React
- TypeScript
- Recharts (for creating charts in the Sorting Visualizer)

## Future Enhancements

- Add more sorting algorithms (e.g., Merge Sort, Heap Sort)
- Implement more operations for the Binary Search Tree (e.g., deletion, search)
- Add visualizations for other data structures (e.g., AVL Trees, Hash Tables)
- Improve UI/UX with better styling and animations
- Add user controls for animation speed
