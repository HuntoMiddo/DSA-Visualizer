Data Structure and Algorithm Visualizer
Overview
This project is a React-based web application that provides interactive visualizations for various data structures and algorithms. It aims to help users understand the inner workings of fundamental computer science concepts through visual representations.
Currently, the visualizer includes:

Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort and Quick Sort)
Binary Search Tree operations

Features

Sorting Visualizer:

Visualize Bubble Sort and Quick Sort algorithms
Generate random arrays for sorting
Step-by-step visual representation of the sorting process


Binary Search Tree Visualizer:

Insert nodes into a Binary Search Tree
Visual representation of the tree structure


User Interface:

Switch between different visualizers
Interactive controls for each visualization



Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
Copygit clone https://github.com/your-username/data-structure-algorithm-visualizer.git

Navigate to the project directory:
Copycd data-structure-algorithm-visualizer

Install the dependencies:
Copynpm install

Start the development server:
Copynpm start

Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000

Usage

Sorting Visualizer:

Click on "Sorting Algorithms" in the navigation menu
Use the "Reset Array" button to generate a new random array
Click on "Bubble Sort" or "Quick Sort" to visualize the respective sorting algorithm


Binary Search Tree Visualizer:

Click on "Binary Search Tree" in the navigation menu
Enter a number in the input field and click "Insert" to add a node to the tree
The tree structure will update automatically to show the new node



Technologies Used

React
TypeScript
Recharts (for creating charts in the Sorting Visualizer)


Add more sorting algorithms (e.g., Merge Sort, Heap Sort)
Implement more operations for the Binary Search Tree (e.g., deletion, search)
Add visualizations for other data structures (e.g., AVL Trees, Hash Tables)
Improve UI/UX with better styling and animations
Add user controls for animation speed
